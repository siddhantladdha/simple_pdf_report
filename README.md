# Usage

I use this for generating simple pdf reports for labs, assignments and stuff using markdown as source.
You already need to be good at markdown to use it and just use this as a template.

To actually make report just finally run `make report`. And yes you do need pandoc, LaTex etc. all the shebang to be
installed.
